# Blazor-Web-Assembly-Dyanmic-3D-.obj-Model-Viewer
This is a Blazor WebAssembly app which uses Javascript interoperability to allow a user to upload and view a 3D model in their browser. It could also potentially be ported to alternative Blazor platform integrations and serve as an example of a platform agnostic desktop application.
